# Responsible AI Guidelines for Silver Pancake

## 🎯 Our Commitment

Silver Pancake is designed with Responsible AI principles at its core. We believe AI should be safe, fair, inclusive, and beneficial for all users while maintaining transparency and accountability.

## 🛡️ Content Safety Framework

### Multi-Layer Safety Approach

1. **Input Validation**
   - Topic and mood input sanitization
   - Character limits and content filtering
   - User intent analysis

2. **Generation Safeguards**
   - Azure OpenAI safety filters during generation
   - Content moderation prompts and system instructions
   - Temperature and generation parameter controls

3. **Post-Generation Analysis**
   - **Azure Content Safety API** analyzes all outputs
   - Hate, violence, sexual, and self-harm detection
   - Severity scoring with configurable thresholds

4. **Human Oversight**
   - User feedback and flagging system
   - Regular human review of edge cases
   - Continuous improvement based on findings

### Safety Thresholds

- **Rejection Threshold**: Content with severity ≥ 2 (out of 6) is blocked
- **Review Threshold**: Flagged content triggers manual review
- **Zero Tolerance**: Hate speech, harassment, and harmful content

## ⚖️ Fairness and Bias Mitigation

### Bias Prevention Measures

1. **Diverse Testing**
   - Regular evaluation across different topics and contexts
   - Cross-cultural appropriateness testing
