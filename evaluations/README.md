# AI Model Evaluation for Silver Pancake

This directory contains scripts and configurations for evaluating the AI meme generator's performance, safety, and responsible AI compliance.

## 🎯 Evaluation Goals

### Content Safety Evaluation
- **Toxicity Detection**: Measure how well our pipeline catches inappropriate content
- **False Positive Rate**: Track legitimate content incorrectly flagged
- **Coverage Testing**: Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### Quality Assessment
- **Relevance**: How well do generated memes match the requested topic and mood?
- **Creativity**: Diversity and originality of outputs
- **Appropriateness**: Professional suitability for workplace contexts

### Bias and Fairness
- **Demographic Bias**: Test for biased outputs across different groups
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Evaluate cross-cultural appropriateness
- **Inclusive Language**: Check for inclusive and respectful language

## 📋 Evaluation Process

### 1. Automated Testing
- Run `run_evaluation.py` to execute automated test suites
- Generate reports on safety, quality, and bias metrics
- Compare results against established baselines

### 2. Human Review
- Regular manual review of flagged content
- User feedback integration and analysis
- Expert review of edge cases

### 3. Continuous Monitoring
- Track metrics over time in production
- Alert on degraded performance
- Regular model and safety system updates

## 🔄 Running Evaluations

```bash
# Run full evaluation suite
python run_evaluation.py --config evaluation_config.json

# Run specific evaluation type
python run_evaluation.py --type safety
python run_evaluation.py --type quality
python run_evaluation.py --type bias

# Generate detailed report
python run_evaluation.py --report --output results/
```

## 📊 Metrics Tracking

### Safety Metrics
- Content flagging accuracy
- Time to detect violations
- User feedback correlation

### Quality Metrics  
- User satisfaction ratings
- Meme relevance scores
- Creative diversity index

### Operational Metrics
- API response times
- System availability
- Cost per generation

## 🔍 Best Practices

1. **Regular Evaluation**: Run evaluations weekly or after any model updates
2. **Diverse Test Data**: Include varied topics, moods, and edge cases
3. **Human Oversight**: Combine automated testing with human review
4. **Feedback Loop**: Use evaluation results to improve models and safety systems
5. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all evaluation runs and findings
